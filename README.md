## Build
<!-- _How to run build_ -->

<!-- 
TODO: needs to pull in React front end from npm. 
eg how it was done in Makefile before

build-electron: build-react
	@echo "Electron build"
	# does areact-build
	# clears build folder inside of electron
	rm -rf ./packages/electron/build
	rm -rf ./packages/electron/dist
	# then copies the react build folder into electron folder
	cp -a ./packages/client/build ./packages/electron/build
	# build/package electron for mac, wind and linux
	cd ./packages/electron && npm run build:mwl

and then run 

```
npm run build:mwl
```

## Tests

 _TBC_

## Deployment
<!-- _How to deploy the code/app into test/staging/production_ -->

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/pietrop/digital-paper-edit-electron/builds/) to build. And add new versions to [github releases](https://github.com/pietrop/digital-paper-edit-electron/releases).
<!-- Probably through Travis or Circle CI -->

However if you want to run a build and package the app locally you can use the npm scripts

To build for mac, windows, and linux
```
npm run build:mwl
```
To build for mac only
```
npm run build:m
```
To build for windows only
```
npm run build:w
```
To build for linux only
```
npm run build:l
```


The build, packaged app will be in the `/dist` folder.
